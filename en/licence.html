                    <p>These Licence Terms and Conditions constitute the full contractual terms
and conditions governing the licence (the ‘Licence’) binding, on the one
hand, SEALD, a French <em>société par actions simplifiée</em> (simplified
limited company) with capital of €5,615, having its registered office at
13 Rue Georges Bizet, 78380 Bougival, France (the ‘Service Provider’)
and, on the other hand, the client (the ‘Client’). The Service Provider
and the Client shall be referred to hereinafter separately as a ‘Party’
and jointly as the ‘Parties’.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
<p><strong>« Additional Services »</strong> means services other than the right to use
the Software that may be provided by the Service Provider in conjunction
with the Software, including in particular configuration, training and
integration services, etc.</p>
<p><strong>« Administration Panel»</strong> means the Software tracking platform
described in the Documentation made available to the Client when he
acquires the paid version. Accordingly, this functionality is available
with the paid version of the Software only.</p>
<p><strong>« Documentation »</strong> means the user document referred to in Appendix 1,
drawn up by the Service Provider to explain the operation of the
Software and its functionalities.</p>
<p><strong>« Error »</strong> means any Software malfunction or non-compliance with the
Documentation that can be reproduced by the Client, which prevents the
normal operation of all or part of the Software, or which causes an
incorrect result or inadequate processing when the Software is used in
compliance with the Documentation.</p>
<p><strong>« Licence »</strong> means the licence granted to the Client by the Service
Provider when it accepts the Licence Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p><strong>« Licence Terms and Conditions »</strong> means this document and its
appendices.</p>
<p><strong>« Software »</strong> means all the object code programs and related
Documentation developed by the Service Provider that are the subject of
the Licence, which enable the Client to perform the operations described
in the Documentation. The paid version of the Software includes the
Administration Panel functionality.</p>
<p><strong>« Specifications »</strong> means the features of the Software, as described in
the Documentation.</p>
<p><strong>« User »</strong> means, as appropriate, the Client or the Client’s staff
members authorised to use the Software within the framework of the
Licence. Each User shall be identified by a personal and unique email
address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of these Licence Terms and Conditions is to define the
general terms and conditions under which the Service Provider grants the
Client a non-exclusive and non-transferable Licence to use the Software.</p>
<p>If the Client requests any Additional Services during performance of the
Licence, it shall supply the Service Provider with a detailed written
report setting out its needs. The Service Provider shall analyse the
Client’s request on the basis of this report with a view to preparing a
written quote. The Service Provider will not provide the Additional
Services until it has received the Client’s prior, written acceptance.
Acceptance shall be recorded in an order form and in special terms and
conditions. The Service Provider will always be free to respond or to
choose not to respond to any requests for Additional Services by the
Client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Term</strong></p>
<p>The Licence will enter into effect from the Client’s acceptance of the
Licence Terms and Conditions and will be entered into for one month or
for one year, as the Client wishes. It will be tacitly renewed for an
identical duration.</p>
<p>Either Party may give notice of termination of the Licence by registered
letter with acknowledgement of receipt or by email, one month before the
Licence anniversary date.</p>
<p>The Client may also give notice of termination of the Licence one month
before the Licence anniversary date, by sending an email to the
following email address:
<a href="mailto:support@seald.io">support@seald.io</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Terms and conditions of use of the software</strong></p>
<p>The terms and conditions of use of the Software will depend on whether
the Client requires the free or the paid version of the Software.</p>
<p>In the case of the freeware, the Client must install the Software on its
computer and provide the Service Provider with its personal email
address; freeware versions are provided on a single-user basis only.</p>
<p>In the case of the paid licence, the Client may decide that the Software
will be used by several Users, who must each install it on their
computer after the Client has sent the Service Provider their personal
email addresses. In that case, the Client will be able to access the
Administration Panel via a password, to be communicated to the Service
Provider; the Client shall be solely responsible for the continued
confidentiality of its password.</p>
<p>The Client undertakes that the Users’ email addresses will be used by
the Users only, and for their own benefit only. It also undertakes to
treat the password giving access to the Administration Panel that is
accessible as part of the paid Licence as confidential and for its sole
use.</p>
<p>The Client shall immediately report any suspected unauthorised use of
any of the User email addresses or its password, as applicable, to the
Service Provider at the following email address: <a href="mailto:support@seald.io">support@seald.io</a>.</p>
<p>In any event, the Client undertakes to restrict access to and use of the
Software to authorised staff members only. Such staff members must
familiarise themselves with the terms of use of the Software.</p>
<p>Any information recorded and stored by the Service Provider concerning
actions carried out via the Administration Panel (such as modifying the
number of Users, making a payment, etc.) may be used by the Service
Provider for evidentiary purposes; this method of proof shall constitute
a presumption that may only be validly challenged by producing evidence
establishing that the Service Provider’s recording and storage tools
were faulty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Software upgrades</strong></p>
<p>The Service Provider may need to upgrade the Software’s functionalities
in line with technological developments or market demand, in particular
by adding or removing one or more features.</p>
<p>Any functional upgrades falling within the initial scope shall not
result in any additional charge.</p>
<p>In the event essential features of the Software are removed or modified,
the Service Provider shall inform the Client at least one month before
they are removed or modified. In that case, the Client may terminate the
Licence by sending an email to the following address: <a href="mailto:support@seald.io">support@seald.io</a>.
If the Client fails to terminate the Licence before they are effectively
removed or modified, it shall be deemed to have accepted the
corresponding removal or modification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User rights</strong></p>
<p>The Service Provider grants the Client a licence to use the
Administration Panel for its own purposes only, and a user licence for
its Users to use the Software in the course of their professional
duties; these licences are granted on a non-exclusive, non-assignable
and non-transferable basis for the entire term of the Agreement.</p>
<p>The term user licence shall be understood to mean the right for the
Client to reproduce the Software, on a permanent or temporary basis,
throughout the term of the Agreement, solely for the purpose of its
download, display, running, transmission or storage, and solely for
those Users whose names have been disclosed to the Service Provider.</p>
<p>In view thereof, without prejudice to the statutory rights recognised in
the applicable legislation, the Client undertakes not to:</p>
<ul>
<li>transfer, sub-licence or grant access to the Software, or otherwise
make it available to any third party in any way whatsoever,
including to any company within its group, and including within the
framework of IT management services or office services, even on a
temporary and/or no-charge basis, unless it has obtained the Service
Provider’s prior, express authorisation;</li>
<li>copy (with the exception of a backup copy, unless this has been
supplied by the Service Provider), modify, disassemble, decompile,
change in any way whatsoever, adapt, fix, translate into any
language whatsoever, transcribe, arrange or make any other type of
transformation to all or part of the Software; merge or even
partially merge the Software with other programs;</li>
<li>remove, conceal or change in any way whatsoever any trademark,
distinctive sign or information about copyright or any other rights
affixed to the Software or any other item delivered by the Service
Provider;</li>
<li>modify or seek to circumvent any of the Software’s protections.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Client undertakes to inform the Software Users of the limitations
placed on the use of the Software under the licence granted hereby, and
guarantees that its Users will comply herewith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intellectual property</strong></p>
<p>The Software shall in all circumstances remain the sole property of the
Service Provider, who is the sole owner thereof and/or holds all the
necessary rights to market and authorise the use thereof.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Client may not pledge, assign, sub-licence, lend or
allow access to it, whether for valuable consideration or free of
charge. Moreover, the Client undertakes to inform the Service Provider
of any infringement of the Service Provider’s intellectual property
rights of which it becomes aware.</p>
<p>The Service Provider warrants that the Software does not infringe any
intellectual property rights or other property rights of third parties.</p>
<p>In the event the Software is, or becomes, in the Service Provider’s
opinion, the subject of a claim by a third party, the Service Provider
may decide, as it sees fit:</p>
<ul>
<li>to arrange for the Client to be allowed to continue to use it, or</li>
<li>to modify it so that it no longer infringes any rights, or</li>
<li>to replace it by suitable software that is functionally equivalent,
compatible and does not infringe any rights.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Warranties</strong></p>
<p>The Service Provider warrants to the Client that the Software’s
functionalities comply with the Specifications described in the
Documentation included as Appendix 1.</p>
<p>Throughout the term of the Licence, the Service Provider undertakes to
use its best efforts to offer the Client all corresponding updates
necessary to ensure a level of security that is consistent with industry
standards. To that effect, the Client undertakes to report to the
Service Provider any problems it may encounter or observe when using the
Software.</p>
<p>The Service Provider does not provide any warranty concerning the
suitability of the Software for the Client’s specific needs, or its
compatibility with any computer program run alongside it. As such, the
Client shall be responsible for assessing its specific needs, evaluating
the suitability of the Software in view of those needs, and ensuring
that it has the necessary skills to use the Software and a compatible
computer environment, as described in Appendix 2. By accepting the
Licence Terms and Conditions, the Client acknowledges that it has
received all necessary information in this connection.</p>
<p>As the Software comprises cutting-edge technology, it is not possible in
the current state of computer science to test and verify all the
possible uses and to warrant that it is free from all Errors. In view
thereof, the Client may, if it considers it appropriate, put in place
suitable plans in the event of a failure or suitable measures to
minimise any harmful consequences of, for example, the loss of data
generated by the Software as a result of its use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial terms</strong></p>
<p>The amount of the Licence fee will depend on the option selected by the
Client when it acquires the Licence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Free version (see Appendix 1 for further information):</p>
<p>€0 per month for a single User, excluding the Administration Panel
functionality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paid version, annual subscription fee (see Appendix 1 for further information):</p>
<p>a flat annual fee of €468 plus € 72 per annum per User managed by the
Client as the administrator via the Administration Panel functionality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paid version, monthly subscription fee (see Appendix 1 for further information):</p>
<p>a flat monthly fee of €49 plus € 7 per month per User managed by the
Client as the administrator via the Administration Panel functionality</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Payments shall be made by direct debit from the Client’s bank account,
or by bank transfer to the bank account indicated in Appendix 1
(information provided when the Licence is acquired) at the start of each
contractual period.</p>
<p>In the event the Client increases the number of Users during the
contractual period, the Service Provider shall issue the Client with an
invoice for the price supplement, calculated pro rata the remaining
number of days in that contractual period. The supplement shall be
invoiced at the time the number of Users is increased.</p>
<p>In the event the Client reduces the number of Users during a contractual
period, the resulting price reduction shall only apply with effect from
the next contractual period. Accordingly, the Client shall continue to
pay the amount initially owed until expiry of the current contractual
period.</p>
<p>In the event of a late payment, including when this is due to
insufficient funds in the bank account or when the Service Provider has
not been informed of a change of bank account or bank card, the Client
shall be charged late payment penalties, without any payment reminder
being sent, corresponding to three times the legal interest rate,
calculated on a monthly basis, plus a flat charge of €40 as compensation
to cover collection costs, in compliance with Articles L441-6 and
D.441-5 of the French Commercial Code (<em>Code de commerce</em>). Additional
compensation may also be claimed when the collection costs incurred
exceed the amount of the flat charge, upon production of supporting
documents.</p>
<p>Non-payment or partial non-payment of any amount that has fallen due
will also entitle the Service Provider to suspend performance of all the
Services subscribed, after expiry of a thirty-day period from that date
and until full payment of all amounts owed, notwithstanding the right to
claim compensation for harm suffered. The Client shall always bear all
consequences of any such suspension.</p>
<p>Prices will always be stated exclusive of taxes levied in France or
elsewhere. The Service Provider’s invoices shall be prepared in
compliance with the applicable tax and social security rules and, when
these change, any resulting price variations shall enter into effect
from the date on which the change enters into force.</p>

<p>The Client warrants that it has taken all necessary precautions to
comply with the Privacy Law, namely by supplying all information
required pursuant to the Privacy Law to the Users, employees and their
representatives. In that connection, the Client warrants to the Service
Provider that the Client’s use of the Software and the performance of
the Licence by the Parties will not constitute a breach of the Privacy
Law under any circumstances.</p>
<p>By way of an exception to the foregoing, the Client acknowledges that
the Service Provider is authorised to carry out certain limited
Processing in its capacity as Data Controller, for the purposes of
analysing and improving the Software and its services. The Client
undertakes to inform its Users of this on behalf of the Service
Provider, and to supply them with the information on such usage to be
found at: <a href="privacy.html">« politique de confidentialité »</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Force majeure</strong></p>
<p>Neither Party shall be liable towards the other Party for the
non-performance or delayed performance of their obligations under the
Licence when this is due to the occurrence of a force majeure event
resulting from any unavoidable and unforeseeable event or circumstances
beyond their control.</p>
<p>Force majeure events shall be understood to mean those events defined as
such in the case law of the Court of Cassation, and any change to the
regulations or any court order or administrative decision that prevents
the Service Provider from operating its business.</p>
<p>Throughout the term of the Licence, any force majeure event, as defined
above, shall suspend the obligations under the Licence for such time as
the event or circumstances persist(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability</strong></p>
<p>The Service Provider will not be liable under any circumstances for any
indirect or unforeseeable loss resulting from the Client’s use of the
Software. The Parties expressly agree that indirect loss shall be
understood to mean any financial loss, business loss, lost profits, lost
data, lost orders or lost customers, and any legal action taken against
the Client by a third party.</p>
<p>In the event the Service Provider’s liability is incurred under the
Licence, the right to compensation for any direct loss suffered by the
Client shall be limited, for all causes and losses combined:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in the case of an annual subscription:</p>
<p>per contractual year, to 50% of the amount paid to the Service
Provider by the Client for the year in which the loss occurs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the case of a monthly subscription:</p>
<p>to three times the amount of the monthly fee paid by the Client
(where the reference monthly fee is the fee paid in the month in
which the loss occurred); capped at six times the amount of the
monthly fee paid by the Client for each calendar year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Audit</strong></p>
<p>The Service Provider may carry out, at its expense, or arrange for any
service provider of its choice, which must not be a competitor of the
Client and must be bound by professional secrecy, to carry out, once a
year throughout the term of the Licence, an audit on the Client’s
premises, on condition that the sole purpose of the audit assignment is
to verify the Client’s compliance with the terms and conditions of this
Licence.</p>
<p>The Service Provider undertakes to give the Client at least fourteen
days’ written notice of any audit assignment, stating the purpose and
the expected length of the assignment and the names of the auditors
attending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Termination</strong></p>
<p>In the event of any serious breach by either Party of any of their
obligations under the Licence Terms and Conditions, the other Party may
terminate this Agreement as of right (<em>de plein droit</em>), thirty days
after a formal demand to comply has been sent by registered letter with
acknowledgement of receipt when this remains without effect, or
immediately in the event of an irremediable breach or a repeated breach
despite a previous formal demand to comply, notwithstanding the right to
claim compensation for harm suffered.</p>
<p>In the event the Licence is terminated, for any reason, all amounts
already paid to the Service Provider shall be retained by it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Right of withdrawal</strong> <em>(applicable only if the Client is a consumer)</em></p>
<p>When the Client is a consumer within the meaning of the introductory
article of the French Consumer Code (<em>Code de consommation</em>), it may in
principle exercise the right of withdrawal offered in Article L.221-18
of the Consumer Code.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in accordance with Article L.221-18 of that Code, the
right of withdrawal does not apply to the supply of digital content that
is not supplied on a physical medium, when use has begun after the
consumer’s prior and express consent and express waiver of its right of
withdrawal.</p>
<p>By accepting the Licence Terms and Conditions, the Client acknowledges
and accepts that the Software will be ready for use immediately upon
subscription. it accordingly expressly waives its right of withdrawal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p>
<p>Under the Licence, each Party undertakes to comply with a general
obligation of confidentiality concerning information obtained from the
other Party.</p>
<p>Each Party undertakes not to disclose to any person whomsoever, directly
or indirectly, all or any part of the confidential information, which is
expressly defined by the Parties as any business, nominative, financial
or organisational information concerning a Party, that has been
disclosed by the other Party (the ‘Confidential Information’).</p>
<p>This undertaking shall apply throughout the term of the Licence, and for
a further five years after expiry or termination of the Licence.</p>
<p>This confidentiality undertaking does not apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>when, following a request by one Party, the other Party authorises
in writing the use or disclosure of the Confidential Information;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when the Confidential Information falls in the public domain,
provided this is not attributable to the actions of the other Party;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when a Party can establish that the Confidential Information was in
its possession prior to performance of the Licence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transfer and outsourcing</strong></p>
<p>The Licence is entered into on the basis of the identity of the Parties
(<em>intuitu personae</em>). The Client may not assign or transfer it to any
third party whomsoever, including to any entity controlled by or
controlling the Client, within the meaning of Article L.233-3 of the
French Commercial Code.</p>
<p>The Client undertakes to immediately inform the Service Provider by
recorded delivery letter (signed for) of any change to the composition
or ownership of its capital that results in a change of control, within
the meaning of Article L.233-3 of the Commercial Code. In that case, the
Service Provider may terminate the Licence as of right (<em>de plein
droit</em>) of law within one month of the said notification, by sending a
registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt.</p>
<p>The Service Provider may freely transfer the Licence provided the
transferee is an entity controlled by or controlling the Service
Provider, within the meaning of Article L.233-3 of the Commercial Code.
In that case, the Service Provider undertakes to give the Client prior
written notice of the transfer. The Service Provider shall be validly
released in the event of the transfer of the Licence in accordance with
this paragraph.</p>
<p>The Service Provider may outsource any of its obligations to a third
party, provided it gives the Client advance notice thereof. In that
case, the Service Provider shall remain liable for all the outsourced
services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advertising</strong></p>
<p>Each Party authorises the other Party to use its name and logo as a
reference in any written, oral or visual communication and on any
medium, subject to prior authorisation, which may not be withheld
without good reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Amendments - Entire agreement - Severability</strong></p>
<p>The Service Provider reserves the right to unilaterally amend the
Licence Terms and Conditions. In that case, the Service Provider shall
inform the Client in writing or by email, no later than one month before
the date on which the amendment enters into effect, unless the amendment
results from regulations that enter into force immediately.</p>
<p>The Client may refuse proposed amendments, in which case it must give
the Service Provider notice of its refusal and of the termination hereof
by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt, before the date on
which the proposed amendments will enter into effect, at the address
indicated below. Refusal shall result in termination of the Licence, at
no cost, and in the reimbursement of the subscription fee on a <em>pro
rata</em> basis.</p>
<p>In the absence of any written objection sent to the Service Provider by
the Client by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt within
the said one-month period, the Client shall be deemed to have accepted
the amendments.</p>
<p>The relationship between the Parties after their entry into effect shall
then be governed by the new version of the Licence Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>It is therefore essential that the Client regularly consult its emails
and read the Licence Terms and Conditions available online <a href="licence.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Licence, the terms and conditions of which are set out in the
Licence Terms and Conditions, constitutes a record of all the
undertakings existing between the Parties, and replaces and supersedes
any earlier oral or written undertakings concerning its subject matter.</p>
<p>In the event any of the clauses of the Licence Terms and Conditions are
found to be invalid or inapplicable, this will not affect the validity
of the other clauses, which shall retain their full force and scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Address for service</strong></p>
<p>For the performance hereof, the Parties respectively elect as their
address for service the address of their registered office or the
address stated at the beginning of this document.</p>
<p>Any change to the registered office or the address of either Party shall
only be binding on the other Party eight days after it has received due
notice thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Governing law — Disputes</strong></p>
<p>The Licence Terms and Conditions are governed by French law, to the
exclusion of the law of any other forum.</p>
<p>The courts of Paris shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear any
dispute arising between the Parties in connection with the Licence Terms
and Conditions and concerning the existence, validity, interpretation,
performance or termination of the Licence, unless the Client is a
consumer within the meaning of the introductory article of the Consumer
Code.</p>

<h3>Appendix 1: Documentation</h3>
<h4>Free version</h4>
<p>The free version includes the Seald desktop application, which can be
installed in the usual way on each operating system.</p>
<p>The registration procedure requires access to the Internet and its mailbox.</p>
<p>Once installed, the application allows you to encrypt and decrypt
documents. Just launch the application, a Seald icon will appear in the
bar next to the time, on which you just have to click to make an encryption
window appear. All you have to do then is follow the instructions.</p>
<p>To decrypt a document with the application (and therefore with a Seald
account), simply double-click on it. It should be noted that it is for
the moment impossible to decipher a document for a user of Seald without
the installed application.</p>
<p>For someone who is not a user of Seald and therefore does not have a
account, simply open the encrypted file in a browser compatible and
follow the instructions.</p>
<p>On Windows, this version also includes the plugin for Microsoft Outlook
(compatible versions in Annex 2).</p>
<h4>Enterprise version</h4>
<p>The Enterprise version includes everything that the free version
includes, with tracking and control capabilities via the Administration
Panel available for one or more administrators (on request) of your
company, and via the application via reduced functionality (such as
opening notifications).</p>
<p>The Administration Panel works in a compatible browser, just open the URL
that will be indicated to you during the provisioning of the account
with the identifiers and passwords that you will have chosen.</p>
<p>Each encrypted element is referenced in this table with its recipients,
how many time it’s been read and a revoke button for each encrypted
element that can be used to prevent them for ever being decyrpted again.</p>
<h3>Annexe 2: Technical configuration</h3>
<p>Seald works on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 SP1, 8, 10;</li>
<li>macOS 10.9 and above;</li>
<li>Ubuntu 18.04 (operation not guaranteed);</li>
</ul>
<p>If the workstation is not at the default settings (via security policy
or other), this can lead to malfunctions.</p>
<p>The Seald file format allowing you to decrypt without installing the
application for recipients who do not have Seald is compatible with the
following browsers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Safari 11;</li>
<li>Google Chrome 66;</li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox 60;</li>
<li>Microsoft Edge 17;</li>
<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 (malfunctions may occur);</li>
</ul>
<p>The plugin for Microsoft Outlook works on Windows 7 SP1, 8 and 10 on
Microsoft 2013 and 2016, and runs on a version with the following
parameters by default Office 365 and/or Exchange.</p>
<p>The Administration Panel is guaranteed to work on Google Chrome 66,
minor malfunctions may occur on others browsers.</p>
